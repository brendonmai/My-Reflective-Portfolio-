Week 1

Lesson review 
During the first lecture I understood very little of the content and the course entirely. I attempted to take down notes within the first section but was quick to give up as without any poor knowledge to the course it didn’t make much sense. It was until I reviewed the slides and completed the pre-work that I started to understand the content in the first module. 

What I learn 

Pre-work:
From completely this work, the main takeaway was what a Complex Adaptive system was and how humans fit into it. 
Complex Adaptive systems is that it is a system in which adapt through two ways learning and evolution and that society is a Complex system. With everyone being the individual parts and not being able to do much while together as a society we advance. 

Slides:
The content from the module one slides was the most difficult for me to grasp the concept of but after studying the slides, I found three major takeaways 
What emergence was and how it works
Example: a single ant can’t do much but when they form ant colonies they perform excellently better
What a socio-technical system was and that a technical and social system was the parts to make it up.
A system where users interact with a technical system
How the parts and the relationships interact with each other to perform functions 

Work
After completing the discussion board for the current week. I was able to complete question 1 & 2 to a satisfactory degree but question 3 is what I found the hardest. Reading through the three models it was obvious that the standing ovation was based on its boundaries then being predictable. The bees worked in patterns but the two cities were the models that I could not understand to the extent as I did the other two models. 

Overall review 
After finishing everything in the first week, I feel like I have a stronger understanding of the basic concepts provided but I struggle with applying the concepts and higher understanding. 






Week 2
What have I learnt this week?
The main topic wwe covered this week was many modelling and how it can  help in situations with people. Dictating and predicting how people would react, especially in crowds. Learning how the wisdom of crowds works and a few examples, such as the submarine.  
What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Many modelling ,The types of many modelling ,REDCAPE and The wisdom of crowds

What insights have I gained?
The main insight in which I was given is the wisdom of crowds and how easily they can be persuaded and their decision influences. If a single answer the whole crowd answers changes towards that given answer.
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
My strength lies with understanding the given concepts and explaining them but my weakness is applying the concepts to a question of any given events. 
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
My main challenge is first understanding the ideas/concepts during the lecture but when reviewing the many modelling in self study. I begin to have a much stronger understanding of the concepts. 
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
To read through the material before the lecture to have a understanding before the lecture 
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The wisdom of crowds

Week 3
What have I learnt this week?
Behaviour models, Decision models, Signalling, Value & Power and Problem Solving 
What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
The main area which I learned about was the Problem Solving section and what heuristics and recombination were.
What insights have I gained?
The main insight in which I gained was how to improve making solutions better and the stuff which can help in making solutions easier to find. Such as decision trees 
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
My strengths were understanding the core concept of what module 3 was and each of the sections covered in the lecture. 
My weakness is understanding the examples presented in the lecture and how it related to the concepts.
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
There was no challenges this week which I did overcome 
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
To ask more questions when the examples are being taught 
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Perspective +Heuristics + Team diversity + Recombination  = Innovation 

Week 4 

What have I learnt this week?
System Dynamics, Networks and Agent based models 
What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
System Dynamics, Networks and Agent based models 
What insights have I gained?
Causal loop diagrams and sink & Flow models where what I learned from the week it being seemly the most useful information from the week. 
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Strength comes from preparing from the lecture having read during the slides and module before so I can't have a better understanding of the content presented. While my weakness is that understanding how everything we learned so far connects together and that the amount of content is overwhelming.
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Organising where to meet up but i believe once we can schedule where and when to meet we could increase each other ability and understanding in the course 
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Do some outside research from just the modules
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Causal loop diagrams and sink & Flow models

Weeks 5
What have I learnt this week?
Aggregating of actions and Power of law 
What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Most things that were covered this week were based in math, so I had knowledge about the concepts discussed during the lecture. Nothing was really now but really just expanded on and put into the context of this subject 
What insights have I gained?
Long tailed distribution
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Strength was understanding the context of this week lecture btu during the class activity , it was there where I struggled. 
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Challenges faced were trying to understand the group assignment and what it was trying to ask us to do but it was silver but looking at each section of the assignment.  
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
To progress further in doing the assignment to finish section 2 
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The power of laws and the long tailed distribution 

Week 6 
What have I learnt this week?
Markov model and Running model  
What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
That you could calculate the probability of anything given the right information using the markov model.   
What insights have I gained?
That when using a random walk model you can use find off if someone who is drunk will fall off a cliff. Meaning any model that had a yes or no effect can be calculated 
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
My strengths and weaknesses are the same as last week, I was able to understand the content but when doing the activities that when I was behind everyone else . 
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I will improve during the class activities by being more in the conversation 
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Finish the assignment and understand everything and being a active part of the class activity 
 
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Random walk and markov 

Week 7
What have I learnt this week?
Segregation models  
What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
The fishern Theorem 
What insights have I gained?
How the majority of the models shown this week could be used in the situation in calculating the Covid.   
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
My strengths and weaknesses are still the same as previous weeks but I'm beginning to understand more of how to do it.  
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them
Improve scheduling with the group to meet up but we were able to properly divide up group work.
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Communication and form a plan.
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Schelling’s Segregation Model

Week 8
What have I learnt this week?
Colonel Blotto games
What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
How the Blotto games could be used in different areas besides warfare such as US election and trials 
What insights have I gained?
That the prisoner dilemma could be used in a range of areas in the world that focuses on the decision of powerful individuals and large companies 
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
My strengths was again understanding the content and also using the models that we have learnt about in the assignment and discovering what models were best to be used.
